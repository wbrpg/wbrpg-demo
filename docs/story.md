The story will begin with the player entering the Adventurer's Institute.
The player will begin with all their stats at a flat base, and the institute will provide the player with the opportunity to raise their stats at an acceralated pace.
This will introduce the stat growth and action system, providing an example of how stats are tied to action success which feeds back into stat growth.
The accelerated pace of stat growth will also demonstrate how the level of grinding can be adjusted.

When the player is ready, they will experience a 10 year time skip, with their stats being adjusted to fixed presets based on their values pre-timeskip.
This will allow the player to get a taste of dfferent builds and how they can all be viable.
For the sake of experiencing different builds, the player will also be able to skip the first part of the game and choose a build.
